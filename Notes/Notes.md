# General Python Notes & Definitions
## Variables
Example:
```python
message = "Hello Python world!"
print(message)
```
Here 'message' is a created Variable and when called (print(message)) the text will be printed

```python
message = "Hello Python world!"
print(message)

message = "Hello Python Crash Course world!"
print(message)
```
Now the Variable 'message' has been replaced, or overwritten.  Both lines will be printed but only the last one will be remembered.

## if Statement
```python
if n > 5:
    pass
```
